Oh, but I know you'll cause me grief
Close friends of mine are in disbelief
As they can see what's underneath
Fluttering lashes, red lips and pearly white teeth
I don't show it but I quiver whenever you come near
And I cannot decipher between the thrill and the fear
I want to stop it but I like it too much to let it stop here
It's wrong but I want you tonight
It's not my own volition but I fell in deep
By running the distance I'd been advised to keep
I trot to the wolf as a doting and sheep
It's wrong but I want you tonight
Fear and delight
All the way through the night
With a little daring do
I'll fall in love with you
I'm the little boy that's gonna be getting fingers burned
But I can see this lesson's gotta, gotta, gotta be learned
They sayâ€¦
